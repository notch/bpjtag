switchend is a simple endianness changer for use with HairyDairyMaid's 
Debrick utility.  To use it give it the binary to change in standard input
and take the switched end off standard input.

It is very trivial; it just take four bytes and swaps the order (so 1234
becomes 4321).  For the last few bytes of the file it swaps the number of bytes
left (e.g. if there are 3 bytes after the rest ofthe file is processed
switched will make 123 into 321 not <null>321, which is would happen if there
weren't special case for this).

E.g. On Linux:

cat bigendian-file.bin | switchend >littlendian-file.bin

and

cat littleendian-file.bin | switchend >bigendian-file.bin

Good Luck!
